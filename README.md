🚀 Crack Your Python Coding Test: A Resource for Aspiring Data Scientists 🐍

During my preparation for a data science interview, I created a Jupyter Notebook to tackle a Python coding test. This notebook focuses on solving algorithmic and logical challenges that are commonly part of technical interviews.

💡 Why is this helpful?
This notebook is designed to help beginners and mid-level professionals understand:
✅ How to break down problems into manageable steps.
✅ Writing clean, modular, and efficient Python code.
✅ Approaching coding tests with confidence.
Whether you're preparing for an interview or simply honing your Python skills, this resource could be a great starting point. I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions to improve it further. Let’s learn and grow together!
